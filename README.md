# PSMJ
1. One version of parallel sort-merge join (PSMJ) which exploits SSDs internal parallelism for high-speed data processing.
2. An software-based power meter with information feedback from hardware by reading MSR register, we control the system power by regulating the processorâ€™s power consumption and capping the process power of PSMJ under power constraint.
